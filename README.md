# Overview


This software serves as the backend for an event discovery app, enabling users to search for local events based on their location, save events of interest, and create their own. Built with C# and the ASP.NET framework, it demonstrates key programming concepts such as data transfer objects (DTOs), interfaces, classes, and functions. It also incorporates RESTful API principles, database management, and user authentication, showcasing C#’s capabilities in a modern web application.

I developed this software to push beyond my previous experience with ASP.NET and deepen my understanding of new concepts in backend development. My goal was to expand my skills, tackle more complex challenges, and become a stronger asset to future employers. Through this project, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience that has strengthened my expertise in C# and ASP.NET, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.
